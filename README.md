# Perfect Dark port

This repository contains a work-in-progress port of the [Perfect Dark decompilation](https://github.com/n64decomp/perfect_dark) to modern platforms.

To run the port, you must already have a Perfect Dark ROM, specifically one of the following:
* `ntsc-final`/`US V1.1`/`US Rev 1` (md5 `e03b088b6ac9e0080440efed07c1e40f`).  
  **This is the recommended version to use**.  
  Called `NTSC version 8.7 final` on the boot screen.
* `ntsc-1.0`/`US V1.0` (md5 `7f4171b0c8d17815be37913f535e4e93`).  
  Technically supported, but not recommended.  
  Called `NTSC version 8.7 final` on the boot screen as well.
* `jpn-final` (md5 `538d2b75945eae069b29c46193e74790`).  
  Technically supported, but requires a separate custom-built executable.  
  Called `JPN version 8.9 final` on the boot screen.
* `pal-final` (md5 `d9b5cd305d228424891ce38e71bc9213`).  
  Technically supported, but requires a separate custom-built executable.  
  Called `PAL 8.7 final` on the boot screen.

## Status

The game is in a mostly functional state, with both singleplayer and split-screen multiplayer modes fully working.  
There are minor graphics- and gameplay-related issues, and possibly occasional crashes.

**The following extra features are implemented:**
* mouselook;
* dual analog controller support;
* widescreen resolution support;
* configurable field of view;
* 60 FPS support, including fixes for some framerate-related issues;
* fixes for a couple original bugs and crashes;
* basic mod support, currently enough to load a few custom levels;
* slightly expanded memory heap size;
* experimental high framerate support (up to 240 FPS):
  * set `Game.TickRateDivisor` to `0` in `pd.ini` to activate;
  * in practice the game will have issues running faster than ~165 FPS, so use VSync or `Video.FramerateLimit` to cap it.
* emulate the Transfer Pak functionality the game has on the Nintendo 64 to unlock some cheats automatically.

**The following platforms are officially supported and tested:**
* Windows 7+: i686, x86_64
* Linux: i686, x86_64
* MacOS: x86_64 (OS 10.9+), arm64 (OS 11.0+)
* Nintendo Switch: arm64

## Running

You must already have a Perfect Dark ROM to run the game, as specified above.  

This assumes that you're using an x86_64 build. If you aren't, replace `x86_64` below with your arch (e.g. `i686`).

1. Create a directory named `data` next to `pd.x86_64` if it's not there.
2. Put your Perfect Dark NTSC ROM named `pd.ntsc-final.z64` into it.
3. Run the `pd.x86_64` executable.

If you want to use a PAL or JPN ROM instead, put them into the `data` directory and run the appropriate executable:
* PAL: ROM name `pd.pal-final.z64`, executable name `pd.pal.x86_64`.
* JPN: ROM name `pd.jpn-final.z64`, executable name `pd.jpn.x86_64`.

Optionally, you can also put your Perfect Dark for GameBoy Color ROM named `pd.gbc` in the `data` directory if you want to emulate having the Nintendo 64's Transfer Pak and unlock some cheats automatically.

Optionally, you can move the data folder to `~/.local/share/perfectdark` on Linux or `~/Library/Application Support/perfectdark` on MacOS.

Additional information can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark/wiki).

A GPU supporting OpenGL 3.0/ES3.0 or above is required to run the port.

### Installing the Nintendo Switch version

The Nintendo Switch build ZIP comes with all 3 regions in different folders: `perfectdark`, `perfectdark_pal` and `perfectdark_jpn`.

Take the folder for the region you want and put it into the `/switch` folder on your SD card, then put your ROM into the `data` folder inside of the folder you extracted as described above.

## Controls

1964GEPD-style and Xbox-style bindings are implemented.

N64 pad buttons X and Y (or `X_BUTTON`, `Y_BUTTON` in the code) refer to the reserved buttons `0x40` and `0x80`, which are also leveraged by 1964GEPD.

Support for one controller, two-stick configurations are enabled for 1.2.

Note that the mouse only controls player 1.

Controls can be rebound in `pd.ini`. Default control scheme is as follows:

| Action           | Keyboard and mouse     | Xbox pad                 | N64 pad                   |

| Aim mode         | RMB/Z                  | LT                       | R Trigger                 |
| Use / Cancel     | E                      | N/A                      | B                         |
| Use / Accept     | N/A                    | A                        | A                         |
| Crouch cycle     | N/A                    | L3                       | `0x80000000` (Extra)      |
| Half-Crouch      | Shift                  | N/A                      | `0x40000000` (Extra)      |
| Full-Crouch      | Control                | N/A                      | `0x20000000` (Extra)      |

| Previous weapon  | Mousewheel forward     | B                        | D-Left                    |
| Next weapon      | Mousewheel back        | Y                        | Y `(0x80)`                |
| Radial menu      | Q                      | LB                       | D-Down                    |
| Alt fire mode    | F                      | RB                       | L Trigger                 |
| Alt-fire oneshot | `F + LMB` or `E + LMB` | `A + RT` or  `RB + RT`   | `A + Z`     or `L + Z`    |

## Building

### Windows

1. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org).
2. Open the `MINGW64` prompt if building for x86_64, or the `MINGW32` prompt if building for i686. (**NOTE:** _do not_ use the `MSYS` prompt)
3. Install dependencies:  
   `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2 mingw-w64-x86_64-zlib mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-python3 mingw-w64-i686-toolchain mingw-w64-i686-SDL2 mingw-w64-i686-zlib mingw-w64-i686-cmake mingw-w64-i686-python3 make git`
4. Get the source code:  
   `git clone --recursive https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark.git && cd perfect_dark`
5. Run `cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -Bbuild .`.
   * Add ` -DROMID=pal-final` or ` -DROMID=jpn-final` at the end of the command if you want to build a PAL or JPN executable respectively.\
6. Run `cmake --build build -j4 -- -O`.
7. The resulting executable will be at `build/pd.x86_64.exe` (or at `build/pd.i686.exe` if building for i686).
8. If you don't know where you downloaded the source to, you can run `explorer .` to open the current directory.

### Linux

1. Ensure you have gcc, g++ (version 10.0+), make, cmake, git, python3 and SDL2 (version 2.0.12+), libGL and ZLib installed on your system.
   * If you wish to crosscompile, you will also need to have libraries and compilers for the target platform installed, e.g. `gcc-multilib` and `g++-multilib` for x86_64 -> i686 crosscompilation.
2. Get the source code:  
   `git clone --recursive https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark.git && cd perfect_dark`
3. Run the following command:
   * ```cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -Bbuild .```
   * Add ` -DROMID=pal-final` or ` -DROMID=jpn-final` at the end of the command if you want to build a PAL or JPN executable respectively.
   * Add ` -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-m32 -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-m32` at the end of the command if you want to crosscompile from x86_64 to x86.
4. Run `cmake --build build -j4`.
5. The resulting executable will be at `build/pd.<arch>` (for example `build/pd.x86_64`).

### MacOS

1. Set up Homebrew.
2. Install dependencies:
   * Execute command: `brew install cmake gcc python3 zlib git`
3. Install SDL2:
   * Execute commands:
     ```
     wget http://libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.30.9.dmg -O SDL2.dmg
     hdiutil mount SDL2.dmg
     sudo cp -vr /Volumes/SDL2/SDL2.framework /Library/Frameworks
     hdiutil detach /Volumes/SDL2
     ```
   * This installs SDL2 system-wide and this is how the automatic builds are done. The game will also look for it in the executable path, so you could
     download it locally instead.
4. Get the source code:  
   `git clone --recursive https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark.git && cd perfect_dark`
5. Configure:
   * Execute command: `cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -Bbuild -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 .`
   * Replace `x86_64` with `arm64` if building for an ARM64 Mac.
   * Add ` -DROMID=pal-final` or ` -DROMID=jpn-final` at the end of the command if you want to build a PAL or JPN executable respectively.
6. Build:
   * Execute command: `cmake --build build --target pd -j4 --clean-first`
7. The resulting executable will be at `build/pd.<arch>` (for example `build/pd.x86_64`).
   * You might need to execute `chmod +x build/pd.x86-64` before you can run it.

### Nintendo Switch

1. Set up the [devkitA64 environment](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started).
   * On Windows you can do it under MSYS2 or WSL, usually MSYS2 is recommended.
   * If using MSYS2, make sure to use the **MSYS2** shell, **not** MINGW32 or MINGW64.
2. Install host dependencies:
   * On MSYS2: execute command `pacman -Syuu && pacman -S git make cmake python3`
   * On Linux: use your package manager as normal to install the above dependencies.
3. Install Switch toolchain and dependencies:
   * Execute commands:
     ```
     dkp-pacman -Syuu
     dkp-pacman -S devkitA64 libnx switch-zlib switch-sdl2 switch-cmake dkp-toolchain-vars
     ```
   * If in MSYS2 or `dkp-pacman` doesn't work, replace it with just `pacman`.
4. Get the source code:  
   `git clone --recursive https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark.git && cd perfect_dark`
5. Ensure devkitA64 environment variables are set:
   * Execute command: `source /opt/devkitpro/switchvars.sh`
   * If your `$DEVKITPRO` path is different, substitute that instead or set the variables manually.
6. Configure:
   * Execute command: `aarch64-none-elf-cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -Bbuild .`
   * Add ` -DROMID=pal-final` or ` -DROMID=jpn-final` at the end of the command if you want to build a PAL or JPN executable respectively.
7. Build:
   * Execute command: `make -C build -j4`
8. The resulting executable will be at `build/pd.arm64.nro`.

### Notes

Alternate compilers or toolchains can be specified by passing `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=whatever` as normal. The port does not build with Visual Studio.

You will need to provide a `jpn-final` or `pal-final` ROM to run executables built for those regions, named `pd.jpn-final.z64` or `pd.pal-final.z64`.

It might be possible to build and run the game on platforms that are not specified in the supported platforms list (e.g. Linux on armv7), but this has not been tested.
